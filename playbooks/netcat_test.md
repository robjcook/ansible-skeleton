To create the CSV file locally on the Ansible controller (the machine running the Ansible playbook), you can modify the playbook to collect the results from each host and then use the `local_action` keyword to write the results to a file on the controller.

Here's how you can adjust the playbook:

### Playbook to Collect Results and Save Locally

```yaml
---
- name: Run netcat test on remote hosts and output to local CSV
  hosts: your_hosts_group
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:

    - name: Install netcat (Debian/Ubuntu)
      apt:
        name: netcat
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Install netcat (RHEL/CentOS)
      yum:
        name: nc
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

    - name: Run netcat to check if a port is open
      command: nc -zv {{ test_host }} {{ test_port }}
      register: netcat_output
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Gather results for local storage
      set_fact:
        csv_line: "{{ inventory_hostname }},{{ netcat_output.stdout | default('FAILED') }}"

    - name: Store results in a list
      local_action:
        module: lineinfile
        path: /tmp/netcat_results.csv
        line: "{{ csv_line }}"
        create: yes
      delegate_to: localhost

    - name: Add CSV header (only if file is newly created)
      local_action:
        module: copy
        content: "Host,Netcat Output\n"
        dest: /tmp/netcat_results.csv
        force: no
      delegate_to: localhost
      when: not file_exists.stat.exists

    - name: Check if CSV file exists
      local_action:
        module: stat
        path: /tmp/netcat_results.csv
      delegate_to: localhost
      register: file_exists
```

### Explanation:

1. **Gather Facts**:
   - The `gather_facts: no` directive is added to speed up execution if you don't need facts from the hosts.

2. **Set Facts**:
   - The `set_fact` task creates a variable `csv_line` with the format `hostname,netcat_output`.

3. **Store Results Locally**:
   - The `local_action` with the `lineinfile` module writes each host's results to a file on the controller at `/tmp/netcat_results.csv`.
   - `delegate_to: localhost` is used to ensure the action is executed on the Ansible controller rather than the remote hosts.

4. **Add CSV Header**:
   - The `copy` module adds a header to the CSV file. This is done only once when the file is newly created, using a conditional check with the `when` clause.

5. **File Existence Check**:
   - The `stat` task checks if the CSV file already exists on the controller.

### Running the Playbook

You can run the playbook with:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i your_inventory_file netcat_test.yml --extra-vars "test_host=192.168.1.10 test_port=80"
```

This will create or update the file `/tmp/netcat_results.csv` on the Ansible controller.

### Example CSV Output

The content of `/tmp/netcat_results.csv` on your Ansible controller might look like:

```csv
Host,Netcat Output
host1,Connection to 192.168.1.10 80 port [tcp/http] succeeded!
host2,FAILED
```

This CSV will be saved locally on the Ansible controller, capturing the results of the `netcat` tests run on the remote hosts.
