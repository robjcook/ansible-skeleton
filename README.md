# ansible-skeleton
Structure to work comfortably with Ansible - do not need to follow all structure to use Ansible.


## Goal and features

The goal of this template is to provide a quick way to start with Ansible. It is a mix of best practices gathered around the web and the result of my own experience. You will find here an extremely modular structure, which should not let the user doubt where to put the correct files. Some advanced topics are covered into [the docs folder](docs/)

Basically, this structure provides:

- A nice default ```ansible.cfg``` file
- A way to organise hosts and groups
- An efficient way to organise variables, depending hosts, groups or environments
- It helps to avoid the recommended messy structure
- Most of files are grouped under directories to avoid confusion
- Provide a nice subset of plugins
- Provide default playbooks to really start quickly your development
- Most of file are shortly documented, with a description of most common patterns

So, just clone this repo, and start to dev :-)


## Quick Start

To help you to start quickly, there are few entry point to have your first playbook working. First, you need to add the targets you want to manage:

```
vim inventory/default.ini
```
Then add your target hosts under the ```[targets]``` section. If you feel lost, checkout the examples inside the file. Once you have done that, you can run the first playbook, which will ensure you have all required roles. If you don't have them, it will download them from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) or from a git repo depending the source. It will install them into ```roles/vendors```.

```
ansible-playbook playbooks/0_local_requirements.yaml
```
Once you get there, you are sure you have all requirements to play with Ansible. Then, we will ensure your inventory is correct by trying to connect on all hosts. Obviously, this playbook will not modify at this stage your targets, it's just to be sure your inventory is ok.
```
ansible-playbook playbooks/1_target_test.yml
```
If it run without errors, you can start to develop you own playbooks and roles. Enjoy!


## File structure

## Compatibility

This skeleton will mainly work with Ansible 2.2. It could run on lower versions, but it has not been tested. Definitely not compatible with 1.x branch. Please checkout the correct branch of this repo to get the matching version.

As this skeleton comes with some python plugins, you may need to install extra Python dependencies if you want to use them:

* string_utils: slugify
* ipaddr: netaddr

Usually, a simple ```pip install slugify netaddr``` should let use those plugins. At this stage, documentation for the plugins is pretty poor, and you may need to read the source code if you want to understand how to use them.
